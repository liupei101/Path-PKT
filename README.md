PathPKT: Towards Understanding and Harnessing the Transferability of Prognostic Knowledge in Computational Pathology

In this work, we use **pan-cancer WSI datasets** (26 cancer, 11,188 WSIs, 9,190 patients) to explore the **knowledge transferability in cancer prognosis**. Concretely, 
- We curate a WSI-based survival dataset for this study, called *UNI2-h-DSS*, derived from UNI2-h. It contains 8,818 WSIs from 7,268 patients, covering 13 cancer diseases.
- Based on UNI2-h-DSS, we find *positive transfers* across a wide range of cancer diseases, in line with human understanding of tumor biology.
- To *understand the transferability of prognostic knowledge*, we investigate
  - What Knowledge Can Transferred Prognostic Models Offer?
  - What Factors May Affect Transfer Performance?
- To *harness the transferability*, we porpose an MoE-based approach that shows to be effective and promising in exploiting the prognostic knowledge from other cancers.

Paper & Codes will come soon. Stay tuned.
